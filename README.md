## What is Hedgehog?
Hedgehog is an easy to use and comprehensive study guide tool. It draws on information from a variety of sources and its wide pool of users. With Hedgehog, users can now effortlessly create their ideal study guide by choosing snippets of information from public user-created general study guides. They are also able to contribute their own knowledge where they see fit. Hedgehog will even sift through specific academic websites to facilitate searching for relevant information.

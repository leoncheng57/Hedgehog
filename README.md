## What is Hedgehog?
Hedgehog is an easy to use and comprehensive study guide tool. It draws on information from a variety of sources and its wide pool of users. With Hedgehog, users can now effortlessly create their ideal study guide by choosing snippets of information (info cards) from the public database on Hedgehog. They are also able to contribute their own knowledge by creating their own info cards. Hedgehog even has an assisted search feature to sift through specific academic websites to facilitate searching for relevant information.

In addition, Hedgehog strives to provide users with a mnemonic generator tool. This tool intends to receive an equation or expression from the user, and to return a random funky meme with a caption to help you memorize it. We know that humans are naturally better at remembering interesting and visual material.

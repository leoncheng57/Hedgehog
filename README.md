## What is Hedgehog?
Hedgehog is an easy to use and comprehensive study guide tool. It draws on information from a variety of sources and its wide pool of users. With Hedgehog, users can now effortlessly create their ideal study guide by choosing snippets of information from public user-created general study guides. They are also able to contribute their own knowledge where they see fit. Hedgehog will even sift through specific academic websites to facilitate searching for relevant information.

## Features
- Login system
- Public study guides
- Private Group study guides
- Organize by topic and subtopics
- Assisted Search Feature
- Hedgehog will search for relevant info when adding to study

## Extras for later
- Mnemonic generator
  - generates an interesting sentence based on an equation/acronym it is given
  - maybe pictures
  - allow user to input a list of words that they find associated with the formula (so that the mnemonic will be more closely related to what the user knows and wants instead of random words)


## Friendly Comments
- This looks really useful -- study guides are always scattered around. The way Hedgehog searches academic papers to generate relevant info as well would be helpful to check and find out more reliable info. I think the mnemonic generator is a really cool idea too, hopefully that'll make it in. -Kathy Wang

- This would be awesome to prepare for any test! The sifting through entire academic websites seems very tough. As an alternative you could ask the user for a url of info and keywords to look for. Then using regex you could just pull out only the important info. -Javis Wu

- This looks like a great way to make studying a lot easier. It would also provide a very customized studying experience, and I think it would be good to alllow users to enter their own sites to parse for information. - Ishraq Bhuiyan

# TO-DO
- [ ] Assisted Search
  - [ ] Compile a Specific Set of Outside Research Sources
  - [ ] Put as a sidebar on the side of the plaintext editor
  - [ ] Maybe search through google for links, then parse links to only accept those that are on our good list of Outside Research Sources
  - [ ] Maybe use APIs of study sites (ex. Wikipedia) or use page scraping to get info from any study site website
- [ ] Login System
  - [ ] Private Groups/Classes/Organizations
- [ ] Topic Organization System
 - [ ] Difficulty/Depth of information
 - [ ] Topics/Subtopics
- [ ] Storage System
 - [ ] Plain Text / Markdown Word Processor
 - [ ] Organized by Topics and Private Groups
 - [ ] All user created
- [ ] Mnemonic Generator
  - [ ] Generate Random Words
  - [ ] Make it sound like a sentence
  - [ ] Find relevant pictures
  - [ ] Maybe Design it like a meme
